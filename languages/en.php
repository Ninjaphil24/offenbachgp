        "about" => "About:<br> <br> Τhe <i>Jacques Offenbach Grand Prix</i> is a new initiative by the <i>Festival Gegen den Strom</i> in Bad Ems.
        This international online singing competition puts Jacques Offenbach in the spotlight and creates a new platform for professional singers where they can present themselves and connect to opera companies and festivals.
        Singers from all over the world will compete with a variety of repertoire, including some mandatory repertoire by the composer, for a chance to win monetary prizes as well as to partake in future productions and masterclasses.
        What makes this event special and unique, is that the audience will be given a voice in the result, as the audience's vote will count like a judge's vote.
        <br> <br> <br>
        Grand Prix and International Summer Opera Academy: <br> <br>
        The <i>Jacques Offenbach Grand Prix</i> is supposed to connect directly to the International Summer Opera Academy - also a new project by <i>Festival Gegen den Strom</i> that was scheduled to start in the summer of 2021. All winners of the Grand Prix would be hired as soloists in the final operatic production of Jacques Offenbach's opera <i>Tales of Hoffmann</i> which would also include students of the Academy for minor roles and ensemble, but due to the pandemic, the Academy had to be cancelled. 
        This year's Grand Prix will take place online and the winners will be considered for future productions of the <i>Festival Gegen den Strom</i> and of the Opera Companies and Festivals the members of this panel represent.",
